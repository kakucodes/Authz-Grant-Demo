# Authz Demo

This repo exists in order to make it easier for developers to get started using the Authz module of Cosmos blockchains.

Currently this shows a small example that will broadcast a tx on the front end but eventually I will update the repo to also include an example of how authz can be used from smart contracts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
